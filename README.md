# Salsa frontend challenge

## Your mission: add message reactions

Message reactions help lower the barrier to engage with content; feel free to implement the feature in whatever way you
think best achieves this goal. You may use additional libraries. You don't need to implement any backend component, and
please limit your time working on this to about 3 hours.

## Dev environment

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```
